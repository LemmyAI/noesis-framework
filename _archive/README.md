# _archive/

Old files kept for reference. **Nothing here is live or used in production.**

| File | Replaced by | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `gather-news.js` | `seed-factory/scripts/gather.js` | Old hardcoded RSS fetcher |
| `generate-seed.js` | `seed-factory/scripts/build.js` + `narrate.js` | Old JS-string-concatenation seed generator |
| `site-legacy/` | `api/public/` | Old copy of UI files that was out of sync |

## Why archived (not deleted)?

These files contain working logic that may be useful as reference if something breaks.
The seed factory scripts were modeled after these originals.
